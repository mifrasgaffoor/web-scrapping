And it did so for good reason!\n\nPAL's unique design is like no other, it brings a new approach to the industry of emergency aid delivery. Unlike previous solutions to delivering aid, PAL propels aid cartridges in the air using the rapid release of highly pressurized air into a cannon shaft.\n\nPAL uses a car battery to power a pressurizer which fills up a pressure chamber with compressed air. When the target pressure is reached, the pressurized air in the pressure chamber is rapidly released into the firing shaft with the turn of a valve. The result is the projectile being fired at extremely high velocities to cover long distances. The air resistance resulting from the blast pulls out the parachute and allows the aid to fall safely on the ground in the desired destination.",

While the organized sector is largely digitalized, the unorganized sector remains predominantly offline. \n\nThere are currently 2 million street food vendors in India generating over $20 billion annually, yet more than 95% of them lack an online presence.\n\nMost platforms overlook these vendors due to their low Average Order Value, which creates a significant opportunity for Raasa Karts. We launched a street food delivery app, perhaps the first of its kind in India, that’s easy to use, can be available in local languages, and offers same-day payments along with third-party delivery riders & with 25 minutes of SLA. This app provides street vendors with their first digital connection to expand their businesses, offering them proper guidance and support for long-term growth.",

This level of navigation precision is something that no other mass-market app has addressed. This is all made possible by our novel location algorithms that use nothing but the sensors on the smartphone to locate the user.
